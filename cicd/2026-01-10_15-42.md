 # Improvement Recommendation
Implement Multi-Stage Docker Builds for CI/CD pipelines.

# Detailed Explanation
Multi-Stage Docker Builds allow creating smaller Docker images by keeping intermediate build artifacts between stages. This approach reduces the final image size and accelerates build times, especially for large projects. It also improves container security by minimizing the attack surface of the base image.

# Benefits
- Smaller final image size and faster build times
- Improved container security by reducing the attack surface of base images
- Enhanced build process organization by separating dependencies and application code

# Example (Dockerfile with Jenkins integration)
```Dockerfile
# Stage 1: Build and compile the code
FROM maven:3.8.0 as builder
WORKDIR /app
COPY . .
RUN mvn clean install

# Stage 2: Copy only the compiled code
FROM openjdk:8-jdk-alpine as runtime
WORKDIR /app
COPY --from=builder /app/target ./
RUN chmod +x ./target/myapp.jar
ENTRYPOINT ["java","-jar","target/myapp.jar"]
```

```Jenkinsfile
pipeline {
  agent any

  stages {
    stage('Build') {
      steps {
        sh 'mvn -B clean install'
      }
    }

    stage('Docker Build') {
      steps {
        sh 'docker build -t myapp:latest -f Dockerfile .'
      }
    }
  }
}
```
