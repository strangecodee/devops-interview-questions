 # Improvement Recommendation
Implement Canary Deployments using Istio in your CI/CD pipeline for gradual release of changes.

# Detailed Explanation
By integrating Istio into your CI/CD pipeline, you can implement canary deployments, allowing you to gradually release new versions of applications to a percentage of users while monitoring their behavior. This approach reduces the risk of deploying new features or fixes that may introduce errors or negative impacts.

# Benefits
- Improved application stability and reliability through gradual releases.
- Enhanced user experience by identifying and addressing potential issues before affecting all users.
- Reduced risk of downtime or service disruption during deployments.

# Example (GitLab)
```ruby
image: maven:3.6.3-jdk-11

stages:
  - build
  - test
  - deploy

variables:
  GIT_STRATEGY: none
  ISTIO_REPO: registry.example.com/istio-release/istio:1.11.1
  ISTIO_RELEASE: 1.11.1

before_script:
  - apk add --no-cache --update curl
  - pip install kubernetes

build:
  stage: build
  script:
    - mvn clean install
  artifacts:
    paths:
      - target/*.jar

test:
  stage: test
  script:
    # Your testing commands here
  only:
    - master

deploy:
  stage: deploy
  script:
    # Install Istio
    - curl -sSL https://istio.io/downloadIstio | sh -
    - mkdir -p /usr/local/istio/istio-${ISTIO_RELEASE}/bin
    - mv istio-${ISTIO_RELEASE}/istio /usr/local/istio/istio-${ISTIO_RELEASE}/bin
    - ln -s /usr/local/istio/istio-${ISTIO_RELEASE}/bin/istio /usr/local/bin

    # Configure and initialize
