# Interview Question
Explain a common strategy for achieving zero-downtime deployments in a microservices environment.

# Answer
A blue/green deployment is a strategy that reduces downtime and risk by running two identical production environments called "blue" and "green."  Only one environment is live at any time, serving all production traffic. To deploy a new version, it's deployed to the inactive environment. After testing, traffic is switched to the new environment, making it the live production environment, effectively achieving zero downtime from the user's perspective.

# Key Technical Points
- Minimizes downtime during deployments.
- Provides a rollback mechanism in case of issues.
- Requires duplicating infrastructure resources, increasing cost.

# Real-World Example
Using Nginx as a load balancer, after deploying to the "green" environment and verifying, update the Nginx configuration to point to the new backend servers, and reload Nginx to switch traffic.  An eclipse-based monitoring dashboard shows real-time traffic shifting to the new deployment, while old logs are archived for compliance.
