 # Interview Question
Can you explain your experience with implementing Chaos Engineering practices using the forge tool?

# Answer
Chaos Engineering is a discipline that focuses on testing infrastructure and systems against various failures and stressors to build confidence in their ability to withstand real-world conditions. The forge tool, an open-source Chaos Engineering platform, allows us to simulate various failure scenarios and evaluate the impact on our systems. My experience includes designing and implementing Chaos Engineering experiments using the forge tool to identify and improve system resilience.

# Key Technical Points
- Familiarity with Chaos Engineering principles and practices
- Experience in designing and implementing Chaos Engineering experiments using the forge tool
- Understanding of how to simulate different types of failures and their impact on the system

# Real-World Example
```yaml
jobs:
  chaos-inject:
    type: chaos
    config:
      experiments:
        - name: NetworkLatency
          inject:
            type: network-latency
            args:
              targetService: my-service
              latencyPercentile: 99
              multiplier: 1.5
```
In this example, we define a Chaos Engineering experiment named "NetworkLatency" using the forge tool's YAML configuration. This experiment injects network latency into the "my-service" target, targeting the 99th percentile of requests and increasing latency by 1.5 times. By monitoring the system's response to this simulated failure, we can identify potential issues and improve our system's resilience.
