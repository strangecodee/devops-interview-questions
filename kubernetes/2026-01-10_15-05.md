 # Kubernetes Concept
This is an example of a Kubernetes DaemonSet for running a Chaos Engineering agent called "Gremlin" to inject intentional faults and test application resilience.

# Explanation
A DaemonSet ensures that one replica of a specified Pod is running on each node in the cluster. Running a Chaos Engineering agent as a DaemonSet ensures that every node in the cluster is subjected to the controlled chaos experiments. This helps in keeping the entire cluster healthy and resilient.

# Best Practices
- Configure Gremlin to target specific services or applications using labels to minimize disruption to non-targeted components.
- Implement proper monitoring and alerting to track the impact of chaos experiments and quickly rollback if necessary.

# YAML Example
```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: DaemonSet
metadata:
  name: chaos-engineering
  labels:
    app: chaos
    environment: production
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: chaos
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: chaos
    spec:
      imagePullSecrets:
      - name: regcred
      containers:
      - name: chaos-agent
        image: forge/gremlin:latest
        ports:
        - containerPort: 2182
        args:
        - --gremlin-home=/var/lib/gremlin
        - --server
        - --server.port=2182
        - --server.bind-address=0.0.0.0
        readinessProbe:
          exec:
            command: ["gremlin", "--version"]
          periodSeconds: 10
        livenessProbe:
          exec:
            command: ["gremlin", "--version"]
          periodSeconds: 15
```
This YAML example defines a DaemonSet named "chaos-engineering" that runs the Gremlin Chaos Engineering agent as a container on every node in the cluster. It uses image `forge/gremlin:latest` and sets up the required ports and readiness/liveness probes.
