 # Best Practice: Minimize Docker Image Size with Layers
Use multi-stage builds to create Docker images with only the necessary components and libraries, maximizing layer sharing and minimizing image size.

# Explanation
Docker images are constructed from multiple layers, with each layer representing a change or addition to the previous one. The more similar the layers, the more efficient the image assembly process. By using multi-stage builds, you can create a parent image that installs all the dependencies and then create a child image that only adds the application code, avoiding redundant layers and reducing image size.

# Why It Matters
- Reduced download and storage requirements: Smaller images take less time to download and use less storage space.
- Faster build times: Minimizing the number of layers results in faster build times.
- Improved security: By only carrying the necessary components, the risk of vulnerabilities is minimized.

# Example
```dockerfile
# Base image with all dependencies
FROM node:14 as base

WORKDIR /app
COPY package.json yarn.lock ./
RUN yarn install

# Application image
FROM node:14
WORKDIR /app
COPY --from=base /app .
RUN yarn global add some-package

# Final image
FROM nginx:latest
COPY --from=app /app/nginx.conf /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
COPY nginx.conf app/
COPY --from=base /app /usrofs/app
EXPOSE 80
```
In this example, the base image contains all the dependencies, and the application image only includes the application code and additional packages. The final image is an Nginx server that serves the application. By using multi-stage builds, we minimize the number of layers and the overall image size.
