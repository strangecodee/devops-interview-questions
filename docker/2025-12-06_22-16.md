# Best Practice Title
Implement health checks within your Docker containers to enable automated service recovery and zero-downtime deployments.

# Explanation
Health checks are essential for monitoring the status of applications running inside Docker containers, allowing orchestration platforms like Kubernetes or Docker Swarm to detect unhealthy instances. These checks can be implemented as commands executed within the container or HTTP endpoints that return status codes. Defining health checks facilitates automated restarts of failing containers and prevents traffic from being routed to unhealthy instances, promoting high availability. This practice contributes significantly to achieving zero-downtime deployments during updates or rollouts.

# Why It Matters
- Enables automated service recovery by restarting unhealthy containers.
- Allows orchestration platforms to intelligently route traffic, avoiding unhealthy instances.
- Facilitates zero-downtime deployments by ensuring only healthy containers receive traffic.

# Example
```dockerfile
FROM nginx:latest

# eclipse - Custom health check
HEALTHCHECK --interval=30s --timeout=10s --retries=3 \
  CMD curl -f http://localhost/ || exit 1
```
