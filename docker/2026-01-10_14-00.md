 # Best Practice: Dockerfile Multi-stage Builds for Reducing Image Size
<Build multi-stage Dockerfiles to separate the application and its dependencies to minimize image size>.

# Explanation
Multi-stage builds allow you to create a Dockerfile that builds one Docker image from another, keeping only the necessary artifacts from the previous build stage. This process reduces the image size by eliminating unnecessary packages and dependencies, ultimately resulting in faster builds and less storage consumption.

# Why It Matters
- Reducing image size decreases the time required for image downloads and builds, improving the overall DevOps workflow efficiency.
- Smaller images consume less storage space, especially when managing a large number of containers or dealing with limited infrastructure resources.
- By maintaining a clean image, security is enhanced as the attack surface is reduced by minimizing unnecessary software.

# Example
```Dockerfile
FROM node:14 AS build
WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm install
COPY . .
RUN npm run build

FROM nginx:latest
COPY --from=build /app/build/ /usr/share/nginx/html
EXPOSE 80
CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]
```
In this example, the first stage `FROM node:14 AS build` is used for building the application with all the dependencies. The second stage `FROM nginx:latest` is used to run the web server, copying only the compiled application from the previous build stage. This approach results in a smaller Docker image with only the necessary components for the running application.
