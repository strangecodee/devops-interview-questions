 # Titan Docker Image Matrix: Version Control with GitOps
<Maintain a well-structured Docker image matrix using GitOps to ensure version control and streamlined deployments>

# Explanation
Maintaining a Docker image matrix involves creating and managing a set of Docker images for various applications and environments. GitOps is a method for implementing infrastructure as code (IaC), enabling version control, automation, and continuous delivery. By integrating Docker images into a GitOps workflow, you can maintain a well-structured image matrix, manage image versions, and promote efficient deployments.

# Why It Matters
- Ensuring version control: GitOps allows you to manage and track changes to your infrastructure, including Docker images, through a version control system. This makes it easier to roll back to previous versions if necessary and maintain a history of changes.
- Streamlining deployments: By integrating Docker images into a GitOps workflow, you can automate the deployment process, ensuring consistent configurations and reducing manual intervention.
- Improving collaboration: GitOps enables teams to collaborate more effectively by allowing them to work together on infrastructure changes, review each other's work, and address issues in a centralized platform.

# Example
```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Namespace
metadata:
  name: my-namespace
---
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: my-app
  namespace: my-namespace
  labels:
    app: my-app
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: my-app
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: my-app
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: my-container
        image: my-registry/my-image:v1.0.0
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: ImageStreamTag
metadata:
  name: my-registry/my-image
  tag: v1.0.1
```
In this example, the GitOps file (YAML) is used to define and manage a deployment with a specific Docker image
